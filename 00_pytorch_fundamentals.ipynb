        "The quote you've provided talks about how to describe the structure of a tensor, particularly in the context of image data, using the specific terminology or \"language\" associated with tensors.\n",

        "\n",
        "Color Channels: The number of channels in an image represents the depth of color information. For instance, a standard RGB (Red, Green, Blue) image has three color channels. Each channel stores intensity values for its respective color across the image. There are also grayscale images, which have just one channel, and other formats that may have more channels (like RGBA, where the A stands for Alpha or transparency).\n",

        "\n",
        "So, when the quote mentions a tensor having \"three dimensions, one for color_channels, height, and width,\" it's describing how an image is structured in a way that's understood by tensor operations. For a color image in the RGB format, you could conceptualize it as a 3D tensor:\n",

        "`torch.stack()` is a function in PyTorch, a popular open-source machine learning library, that is used to concatenate a sequence of tensors along a new dimension. All tensors in the sequence **must have the same shape**. The function is particularly useful when you want to combine tensors in a way that creates an additional dimension, rather than simply joining them end-to-end as in concatenation.\n",

The position of this new dimension in the resultant tensor is specified by the dim parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Result: The result of `torch.stack()` is a new tensor with one more dimension than the original tensors. For example, if you stack three 2D tensors (each of shape [2, 3]) along a new first dimension (`dim=0`), the resulting tensor will have the shape [3, 2, 3].\n",
