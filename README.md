# PyTorch-Introduction
This is my introductory course to the language of PyTorch, which I am following a 25 hours free course from "FreeCodeCamp" and "@mrdbourke"


Online Resources I am referring to: 

    * Youtube Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_xro1bcAuA&t=7913s
    * PyTorch Docs: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html
    * Course Exercise: https://www.learnpytorch.io/00_pytorch_fundamentals/#exercises

I have decided to only include ".ipynb" files for now, as it is how the tutorial goes about it, which also make sense, as Jupyter Notebooks, as far as I see right now is a lot more effective for learning.
